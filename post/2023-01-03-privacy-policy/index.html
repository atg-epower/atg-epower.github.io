As for data processing, strict data filtering and validation and complete data audit are applied. As for data storage, all confidential information of users will be safely encrypted for storage.

<h3 id="information-retention-period">Information Retention Period</h3>
<p>We process your personal data for the minimum period necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy , unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the data for a longer retention period.

When we are unable to do so for technical reasons, we will ensure that appropriate measures are put in place to prevent any further such use of your personal data.</p>
<h3 id="links-to-third-party-websites-and-services">Links to Third Party Websites and Services</h3>
